## 📤 Deployment

There are several ways get portosaurus up and running.


### 1. GitHub Pages

GitHub provides free hosting service for static sites (like portosaurus).  

To host, we need to create a repository named `username.github.io`. The site will be live at `https://username.github.io/`.

Here are the steps:

1. Use the `use this template` button at top right corner & choose `Create a new repository` option.
2. In the following page, name the new repository `yourUsername.github.io`, like for me it's `soymadip.github.io`.
3. Now edit the [`config.js`](./config.js) with appropriate details.
4. Go to repo settings > `pages`> `Build and deployment`>`Branch` & select `gh-page` from the dropdown, hit save.

The site should be up and running after a few minutes.


### 2. Manual building

Also you can compile the source code & manually upload/host with your preferred hosting service.

In your terminal, paste these commands:-

```bash
git clone https://github.com/soymadip/portosaurus
cd portosaurus && git switch main
npm run build
```
This will compile the site and put them in `build` dir.


## 💻 Development

Source code can be found at `code` branch.

- Run the local development server:

    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

- Build the website:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

- Serve the built website locally:

    ```bash
    npm run serve
    ```
