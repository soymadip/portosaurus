# Interactive Previews

Portosaurus transforms static links into an **interactive multitasking system**. Instead of forcing users away to a new tab, Interactive Previews keep them engaged with your content by opening references in a premium, responsive window.

### `<SrcPv />`
A specialized trigger for lists. Perfect for "Resources" or "Downloads" sections.

```jsx
<SrcPv 
  prefixText="Resources: "
  sources={[
    { path: "https://github.com", label: "GitHub" },
    { path: "/manual.pdf", label: "User Manual" }
  ]} 
/>
```

## Why use Previews?

- **Keep the Flow**: Users can view PDFs, images, or code without losing their scroll position on the main article.
- **Contextual Learning**: Display a code sample in a side-dock while the user reads the explanation.
- **Immersive references**: Show full external websites or complex documents in a beautiful, controlled UI.

## The Core Component: `<Pv />`

The `<Pv />` (Preview) component is your primary tool. Wrap any link or text with it to make it "Preview-able".

```jsx
<Pv href="/resume.pdf">View my Resume</Pv>
```

### Automatic File Detection
You don't need to tell Portosaurus what kind of file it is. The system automatically detects and renders:
- **Documents**: PDFs (with zoom/search).
- **Code**: 100+ languages with syntax highlighting.
- **Images**: High-res previews with click-to-zoom.
- **Websites**: Full external sites with a "Visit" fallback.

## Choosing your Layout

Portosaurus features a **3-tier adaptive engine** that ensures your previews look great on any device. You can set the starting `mode`, and the user can switch between them using the header controls.

### 1. Popup (The Immersive Choice)
The default mode. It opens a centered, high-contrast modal that focuses the user's entire attention on the document. Best for Resumes, full-screen images, or critical references.

```jsx
<Pv href="/design-spec.pdf" mode="popup">Open Specification</Pv>
```

### 2. PiP (The Multitasker)
**Picture-in-Picture** mode creates a floating window that stays visible while the user scrolls the main page.
- **Mobile**: Becomes a YouTube-style mini-player at the bottom.
- **Desktop**: A sleek floating window you can drag anywhere.

```jsx
<Pv href="/demo.mp4" mode="pip">Watch Demo while reading</Pv>
```

### 3. Dock (The Pro Workflow)
Splits the screen to show content side-by-side.
- **Desktop**: Pushes the documentation to the left and docks the preview to the right (like a professional IDE).
- **Mobile**: Becomes a bottom-half "Peek" sheet.

```jsx
<Pv href="/api-example.js" mode="dock">View Code Side-by-Side</Pv>
```

## Advanced Features

### Tabbed Collections (Multi-Source)
You can group related files into a single preview window using the `sources` prop. Users can switch between files using an integrated tab bar.

```jsx
<Pv 
  title="Project Source"
  sources={[
    { path: "/src/index.js", label: "Logic" },
    { path: "/src/styles.css", label: "Theme" }
  ]}
>
  Browse Project Files
</Pv>
```

### Stable Deep Linking
Every preview generates a unique URL hash. If a user finds a specific file in your dock, they can copy the URL and share it. When the next person opens that link, Portosaurus will **automatically open the previewer** to that exact file and mode.

**Format**: `#my-slug:pv-dock`
